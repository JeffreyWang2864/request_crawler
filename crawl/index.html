			Long story short. Was I impressed? No. Would I go here again? Maybe not. Let me begin by saying if you are vegetarian you may not like this restaurant. But if you like the Hyderabadi veg dum biryani then you may like this restaurant. First of I don't like biryani simply because I find it dry and full of uncooked and unbalanced masala. 3 other people who were with me liked the biryani. Service was one of the worst though. A popular restaurant (which this was) should run like a well oiled machine. However the servers weren't very efficient. I'm not sure if it was because it was Deepavali or generally this restaurant is busy but it was full. We only tried the biryani and the vegetarian appetiser platter (pretty small for $12) and the mirchi bhaji (this was extremely spicy) The restaurant seems to be more popular for non vegetarian dishes.  For me it was slightly below average. <br>

			Best Indian buffet I've had in the Greater Boston area so far - huge variety and everything is excellent. Especially love their South Indian Chicken/Goat curries. <br>

			I was there for the past two Saturday's, I go for the open buffet they have so many selections and the food taste amaaazing and the price is so affordable, only $15 a person all you can eat and fruits included and some juices. Most what i like a bout that the food is Halal and you cant find that every where. There is enough parking thankfully and the staff is nice. <br>

			Lots and lots of sauce, no meat, broken Mango Lassi machine. The taste was not too bad but it's all sauce and food barely gets refilled before it's gone again!! There are better in the area. <br>

			The reviews on Yelp perplex me but maybe I'm missing something because the restaurant was full of those of this ethics cuisine but still my food was not to my liking, not at all. Came here after work and the place was crowded with people, I was the only Caucasian in the place. I had at that moment very high hopes. The menu was diverse and even offered some Asian fusion blends of southern Indian cuisine. They do not serve wine as advertised on Yelp but as no one else was drinking I was fine with it. No need on a Monday night. The restaurant is very open and bright with paper place mats for utensils and what feels like Pyrex plates. It screams cheap eats but it really is not based on the standard prices on the menu. I ordered the chicken curry, mutton vindaloo and the lamb biriyani. The sauces were more lumpy than I've seen before but the flavors were good. Until I got to the meat. Rarely have I found bone in my chicken curry. Likewise the pieces of mutton on the plate of biriyani were extremely fatty and most had bone. Over half of the mutton was inedible. The lamb vindaloo was better but I found something soft I couldn't identify. Best not to dwell too much. I brought almost all of it home as I couldn't eat it all and wouldn't. While I will not return something truly draws the people here based on the reviews and the clientele. Some people love the fat on barbecue, I'm not one of them and like this place I'm not going to become a long term client. Many ordered the dosas but even those looked as tho they had little filling to account for the price. Cheap eats it is not but cheap on the quality of food most definitely. The three stars? Hard to say I couldn't give it two based on the clientele. The nice staff and the lamb vindaloo and chicken curry I did first enjoy, if not with trepidation. Maybe others have better experiences than I had but I was extremely disappointed! This is not the Indian fix I wanted. <br>

			This place was quite good when they first opened, but it's not what it was anymore. They are extra slow with take out orders (they tell you 30 minutes and you'll still wait at least another 10-15 before leaving), the food is overly salty, lines for lunch are outrageous. In a location where Indian cuisine is highly populated, I would rather go elsewhere with quality and better prices. <br>

			First horrible experience at Godavari. Its around 2.30PM four of us reached for their lunch buffet. Items in menu sounded promising and few people items were missing and when i reached to them they said they would fill them up soon. But it took them forever to refill it. They had interesting item ulvacharu chicken in their course when i tried it first time i liked it and they vanished soon. It took them very long to refill and once they refilled i tried it was shocking it wasn't the same kind of chicken that we ate earlier it was tandoori chicken dumped in ulvacharu. The next one they had peanut chutney which was liquid enough to be called as sambar and it was ginger chutney rather than a peanut chutney. The items were not filled soon and we had to wait with empty plates they just managed to do some refill to make sure they are refilling till 3:30. Seriously a big disappointment over the weekend the fastest and tastiest chain in US for south Indian food turns out to be a disaster. <br>

			I had heard good reviews about the food here, so thought will give it a try, even though it's a bit far from me, but when I reached more than an hour before the usual closing (which I checked on the website before going), the gentleman at the desk told us they running out of food and refused to accommodate us. He was not particularly welcoming and was in a rush to somewhat 'boot us out'. By then, all other restaurants also closed down so it became a bad eveningTheir food is probably good, but I am not risking another hour's drive to be disappointed again. Good food is one of things people go out to eat for (not the only one) There's a difference between good business and good hospitality and I hope the management is able to appreciate that soon. <br>

			The food is good but the service is so bad it's almost comical. The staff are unsupervised and serve you in a random unpredictable way. The staff mostly cluster around the cashiers desk chatting and staring at their customers. We stood at the door for 15 minutes before we were able to catch someone's eye. He showed us to a table buried away near a storage area. We waited 15 more minutes and then moved ourselves to another location. It was an hour before we began to eat. The order arrived one by one with about 10 minutes between each. First the yogurt then the roti then the chicken then the biryani. Each served after the earlier dish had been eaten. We'll probably never come back here but I would be remiss in not mentioning the food is pretty good. That's why they get a star. <br>

			Ok ...we were fans of Godavari and almost 5 stars. We drive down to this place for their buffets and generally leave happy.Just been there today...they remodeled and all but quality is clearly suffering. The papad was like as if served in the same oil container in which it was fried, poori was also terrible and oily.The desserts were awesome except for custard that they don't get right. Yogurt rice is one of the best.I really hope they do not go down the path of decreasing quality like many restaurants and today's visit makes us less of a fan and will be a while before we come back and that is sad -:(. We were proud of this place until now... <br>

			Visited for weekday lunch buffet. Poor service!!The items are never refilled until we ask them!!! And they took around 10-15 min to refill during peek hours!!!Coming to food, Chicken Biriyani and gongura rice were good. Special mention to the Sambar. So far the best sambar in Boston area!! <br>

			Below average food, pathetic service - the food was dropped on the table instead of being served. The server handed me my plate because he couldn't wait long enough to make space on the table. We had to ask for chutney 3 times before it made it to our table. One of the servers also touched the trash can right after delivering food. We were extremely disappointed with our visit and wish we had gone somewhere else. <br>

			Every weekend we turn to Godavari for a Sunday buffet and we are even more in love with it since they renovated and expanded their restaurant... But there are serious things they should start considering!!! 1. To provide chicken or goat dum biryani for Saturday and Sunday lunch buffets 2. To not allow so much of waiting crowd into the restaurant. It's really disturbing to people who are eating 3. After expansion, there are more people coming into the restaurant, please provide enough food for all... <br>

			I don't know if this place is related to the Godavari in Long Island, NY (Hicksville) but this place is a gem. Many Indian buffets are lacking in selection or quality dishes but this place has both, ranging from rich daals to thick curries to various crunchy fried items both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. The first sign that you've landed in the right place is that over 50% of the lunch diners here are Indian. (I don't know about you but I don't get good vibes from restaurants which cooks food of a certain culture but yet members of that same culture eschew them). A lot of people stop here for their lunch break during work (a good sign). They don't skimp on the spices (not to be confused with heat). Service was attentive but not intrusive. I felt very much at home; even though it wasn't the same type of curries I ate in Singapore as a little schoolkid, it definitely felt like they were cooked with the same type of love I remember street hawkers putting into my food as a ten year old. <br>

			I am going to update my review here and add another star. The onion and chili utappa was too spicy but the guys very kindly replaced it with a less spicy version. Honestly speaking I love this place but I find everything I have tried so far too spicy. My friends have stopped going to this place because of its spice levels. If only they could take notice of it. Thanks in advance! Below is my previous review -Tasty food but super slow service. I would love to go back again and I did once but repented again. There's nothing really to say about this place except for please please please improve your service. I am sure other people would love that too. We spent more time waiting for the food than actually having it. The menu is good, the food really good, prices are great too, an okay ambience but terrible service. I hope they will some day! <br>

			For all of you who don't know what Godavari is, it is name of a river (and a place) in southern part of India. Food in southern part of India is very different from northern part - south India is very famous for different kinds of breakfast and spicy food!Godavari Woburn is one of the best south Indian restaurants I have been to in the US. I grew up eating food they serve here so I know that this is authentic Indian food and buffet here is a must try.I suggest going a bit early to beat the rush if you are planning on visiting this place for lunch on a workday. Vegetarian food is physically placed in a different row than non-vegetarian food, which is a good thing. There are a couple of appetizers during buffet like mirchi bajji, onion pakoda etc., Sambar here is so good that just thinking about it is making my mouth watery! They generally have white rice, some special rice like coconut, biryani, couple of curries, sambar, rasam. There is coconut, groundnut and tomato chutney for uttapam - groundnut chutney (brown color) is my favorite of the three!You can end the meal with curd rice (yogurt) and couple of desserts. Don't forget masala chai, you can take it to go to stay awake for a while after a huge meal.Waiting staff is very friendly, quick to clean up the tables, refill water and dishes in buffet. I heard that they are opening another branch in Framingham and they have many other branches all over the US.Icing on cake: If you check-in on yelp as of July 21 2016, you get $2 off on your bill! <br>

			I go to meditation next door and finally decided to try Godavari last night. They were great about ordering take-out in person and having it ready 30 or so minutes later. I loved the inside and think it'd be nice to relax and eat there. I ordered the mutton biryani (mild) and a goat dish. I asked for the goat dish to be spicy and they did not disappoint. My friend loved it. I thought the biryani had a bit of a kick to it but it wasn't over powering so I enjoyed it. I loved the smell of the food - so rich and perfumey. I didn't see the usual naan bread that we like but I was in a hurry. The price for the two dishes (which were huge) was fantastic. I'm just not a fan of all the bones; I understand goat but it's a new thing to me to have bones with mutton or lamb. We'll definitely go back either to eat in or try take-out. <br>

			One of those rare places where you will find authentic Indian food with spice levels matching the Indian palette and is easily one of the top places for Indian Cuisine around the city. No wonder this place is always crowded! Normally there's always a long wait for a table (we've walked away several times in the last few months because of the hour long wait time). Today we were determined to try the much talked about buffet so we walked in half an hour before the restaurant could open and to our surprise there were people already sitting in, waiting for it to open too! Today marked the grand opening of the extended half of the restaurant. They've changed the interiors and made it more fun by adding elements from a classic Indian dhaba with Telugu songs playing in the background.The food as usual was excellent! They had a very wide variety of offerings for both vegetarians and non vegetarians. The best part is they offered a lot of authentic South Indian dishes which are hard to find. The dessert section had 3 options including pudding, aam rass and the chickoo shake which was to die for! But my favorite was the masala fish which was served inside a banana leaf. The staff is very friendly and jovial and will keep you entertained.P.S don't forget to try their garlic fish/chicken and Kingfisher beer! <br>

			Ome of the most sought after indian buffet places. They carry a very peculiar south indian food taste. So don't go here thinking you ll get the best north Indian or punjabi food. Their south Indian food is finger licking good. Gets packed on weekends they just expanded so not hard to find place. They even have a food truck. <br>

			I really like Godavari. It's changed hands a few times and my former in laws (who are Indian) don't LOVE it, but I do and know it does the trick in a pinch. (Supposing you don't know an Indian family to feed you at home, this place is pretty good). Decent biryani, nice mutton fry (ask for it dry) and delicious lassi!! Their dosas are delicious as well. Check this place out. It's fast, near a major road so you can get lost and usually had plenty of parking. <br>

			One star for service and a second one for ambiance. Place has expanded and waiters are attentive. Nice background music. Food however is subpar. Buffet lunch had only chicken meats. No lamb, fish. No tandoori. Needs fuller description on whats on each dish and how spicy: ie cheese spicy 4 out of 5 etc <br>

			It was our first time here. Mom heard good reviews from my aunt. I wasn't impressed though. There were a ton of dishes for the lunch buffet, some of them were cold from sitting out. I found the food super spicy and I can handle some heat. If you haven't had South Indian food it might not be what some may be use to like North Indian food which is found in majority of restaurants and buffets. <br>

			I admit having had chaat at Rajbhog in Jackson Heights, Queens last night was not good preparation for coming here. But Wow! I was thoroughly unimpressed with the food. And not just a sevral things; across the board objectively bad. Biggest issues were that the food was not fresh.I ordered the South Indian food since they're marketed as 'Truly South Indian'.Sambar Idli 1/5. From someone who doesn't mind denser idlis, it was still too dense for me. Not rock hard, but wasn't fresh and was definitely not soft as a pillow. (And yes, I know they microwave these, but this was cooked many days, if not weeks ago).Sambar Vada 0/5. They were small and fried, but not much beyond that. Under seasoned, over salted, . Under cooked, doughy, center, fried crispy outside that got lost in the under cooked center. Chutneys could not undo the texture. 3 came in the order, 2.5 sent back. Hopefully I don't get sick.Masala Dosa 2/5. Dosa 3/5. Masala 1/5. Dosa was a bit greasy and thin. Couldn't get any sense of flavor when it's so crisply and thin. Masala, like the idli, was not fresh.I also had a taste of the flavorless uthappam (1/5) and overpoweringly hingy/asafoetiday samosa(0/5). When walking out, I looked at all the other tables and saw none had ordered south Indian. Maybe that's why my experience was different from others'. Still unacceptable to call this 'Truly South Indian'. I'm not even curious to try their North Indian menu. <br>

			One of the best places if not the best place to try great Indian food and easy on the pocket. The staff is friendly, ambience is great, food is superb. Tried the Tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala, and hyderabadi chicken biryani. 10/10 for the food except the biryani which was decent but not the best iv had in Boston. 8/10 for the biryani. The desserts were awesome, gulab jamun & ras malai.  Must visit place if ur a foodie and love Indian food. Will definitely go again. The lunch buffet is vast and great variety of food for 14$ <br>

			Food is avarage. Iam here for july 4th for lunch buffet . Appetizers are full of food coloring and sesame seads. And fish and chicken same tatse . Liked oly veg punuku , in appetizers. but it also consists of sessme .  Currys- Butter chicken curry , dal are good .Nattu kodi and prawns currys , paneer ,are sweet in taste . Biryani- total disaster . smells and taste is overpowering with pudina . Can call pudina biryani. Desserts- samya payasam -vary watery , custrud is avarage. Tea is good . Most off crowd are students. They will like the food bcz they will miss indian food . But for indian families its waste . We will be disappointed by food colors and similar tastes in all curries. Service- after W8ing for 30min we are seated. But no one came to ask for drink . They are around 4 boys serving all ,are vry busy . We refilled our own water glasses. And we placed our own used plates in trash . <br>

			I would honestly have given them ZERO stars if I could, but can't do it here. Tried it once and never coming back again. The service is definitely the worst I've ever seen in the Boston area. Here's everything that I had to deal with:Cleanliness - The people cleaning the tables are the ones serving the food. They are also the ones handling the to-go boxes and taking orders. There is no cleaning hands in the middle. First sign of mismanagement and irresponsibility.Seating - There was no one at the door to get you seated. There's a huge queue waiting to get seated and there's a tiny book where you have to put your name down. Luckily, one of the couple's waiting told us to do it otherwise, we would just be waiting forever. We got our tables after 30 mins while one was sitting uncleaned for all of that time. Ordering - It took the servers 15 mins to get to our table. After overhearing some people that food was taking over an hour to come out, we ordered as soon as someone showed up. We were told the food will take 15 mins. Food - Well, we waited 1 hour to get our Idli with completely cold Sambhar. Then waited another 30 mins to get our Dosa. We had also ordered fish for the table. After asking the servers 5 times about it (over 2 hours passed since we ordered), none of them seemingly caring about it they finally said 5 mins. After 10 mins, our server told us if we want to cancel the fish coz it was burnt/overcooked. At this point, after waiting over 2 hours, we didn't even get to do dinner coz they messed up our order so bad. I was furious but just asked for the check and decided to leave. Service - What can I say. It was the worst ever. We asked for water, hot Sambhar, the fish, clean napkins...but nothing ever came except water that was refilled once. An absolute nightmare. It seemed like they were all preoccupied with filling the phone orders which were coming out every 2 mins. They also tried to give us wrong dishes 3 times. We also noticed people waiting for over 30 mins to give their order and complaining on the nearby tables.Never coming back here. Can't believe how they have so many decent reviews, probably regulars who come at off hi hours. Management please take notice if you care about your regular sit down restaurant business! I'm definitely spreading word of my experience. <br>

			I went with my parents on a Tuesday night and had a terrible experience. We ordered some idlies and few dosa. The food was not hot at all and tasted stale. Dosas were the worst I have had in my life. We got there at 7:15pm and the dosas arrived on our table at 8:20pm. Who serves this late!? Also, the service is general was terrible. We asked for chutney and we only got it after half n hour. Never order spring dosa! All they did was used mysore dosa and added RAW cabbage and green pepper. This restaurant is definitely losing its taste. I really hope they improve or at least keep their name. It used to be good. But like any other Indian restaurant, NOT ANY MORE! I feel bad that I took my parents here. They had a HORRIBLE experience. <br>

			Food used to be great, but now is often cold, overcooked, raw spiced and unpleasant. I could still recommend the medu vada and gongura chicken kabab. But the long wait for a table on weekends, long waits for some dishes like dosa and frequently unavailable items on the menu has taken Godavari off my go-to places. <br>

			After trying a good 8 or so places, all with absolutely horrible food, I'd given up on Indian in this area until a friend recommended Godavari.This place is fantastic! Southern Indian as well! The last solid Southern Indian place I'd found was in Manhattan and they are long out of business, so that was a big added bonus.I went for dinner, not buffet. It's always encouraging when you walk in and find a place packed with diners of the ethnic origin matching the restaurant's cuisine.We had a handful of the apps, the veg pakoda and the samosa were really good the samosa was really nicely seasoned. The chicken tikka masala was awesome (for some reason up here everyone makes it with a massive amount of vinegar in it, it's not supposed to be sour) and I had the chicken Chettinadu and it was perfect. The naan was also very well cooked and flavored (we had the garlic).If you are a fan of hot food, this place will be a hit. "spicy" is very well balanced, good and hot but not so much it wipes out the overall flavor of the dish. If you are sensitive to hot foods be sure to tell them to make your dish mild and they will.Portions are very generous, service is very friendly and attentive. Prices are very reasonable. The decor is super casual and quirky. It's a bit noisy but not overly so.I'm very happy to have finally found a solid Indian place after two years of horrible mistakes. <br>

			This place is truly amazing in terms of food (if you are into spicy food) and hospitality.Its lively with vibrant staff and management.I happened to order food for a surprise party I had at my place and the Godavari team made sure that the surprise was indeed intact (they agreed to deliver the food exactly when I called them). The food was just the way I wanted ,all the minute changes mentioned to the menu were taken care of and all the items were delicious. A favorite for everyone of my guests is 'rajugari chicken' .Each one of them made it a point to visit this place again <br>

			This restaurant used to be good. We arrived at 7.30pm on a weeknight. Restaurant is open till 10pm. They ran out of coconut chutneys for our appetizer. We were told there was a long wait if we ordered dosas. Food took forever to arrive. We ordered Channa batura, came with 2 baturas, but the channa was not enough even for 1 batura. Food was not hot. We were not offered refills. Very disappointed. Didnt enjoy as much as I remember from my previous visits.Now looking for alternate restaurants with good vegetarian options. <br>

			This is one of the best Indian food in Boston. It has a great blend of authentic South Indian and North Indian taste. I have tried many things such as chicken chettinad, chicken biryani, lamb curry, gobi manchurian(it was awesome), garlic naan everything was good but sometimes Its little oily. Overall great place to go for an Indian meal. The Buffett is also nice with some great desserts. Mango lassi is a must try. <br>

			They take orders only from their regulars. So if you're new, don't even bother wasting your time driving all the way. Their kitchen closes an hour before the closing time. While they told us that only biriyani was available, we heard them taking dosa, naan and curry orders from adjacent tables. How would you get new customers if you only cater to serve the ones who frequent your place? We've been to plenty of Indian restaurants across US and this is the worst experience we've ever had! A note to the management; Either train your staff to be professional or hire folks who demonstrate basic courtesy required for such jobs. <br>

			Save your money and belly. This restaurant is the worst in Boston area. The service and food is sub optimal. We had an adverse reaction to this restaurant's food. Additionally, servers don't remember what you ordered and when you ask for something common with South Indian food (e.g.: chutney with your dosa, they tell you that chutney is not served with this dosa). It's a customer's decision on how to eat their food not the restaurant's. We later found out that the restaurant had not prepared chutney at all!!If you are reading this review, stay away from this restaurant, or if you do go, be ready to end up in the nearby Lahey clinic! <br>

			South Indian buffet. Love it. Very fresh, tasty and clean. They had duck curry which is not something I usually see at Indian places. Plenty of briyanis and vegetarian options. The red wings are very good! You'll pay just $15 per person. Worth it for the quality of food offered here. If you're finding this place with GPS just note the place faces the Main Street, across from dunkin donuts. Just look for the crowd of Indians waiting to get a table. <br>

			Went here for dinner by myself, while traveling on business. The location is pretty convenient, just off of I-90. Dining by ones self at any Indian restaurant means you will be taking things home, the portions are meant for sharing.I had my two favorite dishes, the Lamb Vindaloo and Aloo Gobi. One vegetarian dish and one non. Plus some butter naan. Dishes were served with rice. I basically had enough for two, so I took half home for my lunch. Both dishes were excellent. I ordered the medium heat since I haven't tried this place before, and the heat was perfect.Atmosphere was relaxed with some nice music playing. The place started to get crowded at about 7:30pm. They have a buffet for lunch but not for dinner. <br>

			Open at 12 on weekends. $14 with tax for the weekend buffet. Authentic south Indian food with at least 3 types of briyani and a pilaf. You'll be spoiled with all the variety they put out.Plenty of vegetarian options n for the carnivores too. Heat level of food is spicy. They are catering for the South Indian community in the North Shore, so if you like your food mild-you are not going to enjoy the food here. But come anyways to try the authentic spice of South Indian cuisine. Service is good. some waitstaff are very attentive n helpful while others are not so. Highly recommended <br>

			This review is for service only. Horrible wait staff, they have no patience and the wait to get a table is barely organized. They had a few tables empty but no one was seated there, we where left waiting for 10-15 mins staring at empty tables. After being seated it took the staff about 20 mins to take our order, totally rude wait staff. Food was great but not sure if it's worth the wait and dealing with the wait staff! <br>

			Had been in this restaurant with my mom n dad. There were not many dishes in the buffet, just two. We though that there wud b refill, so we were waiting. But there was none. So we went for check, and the waiter told that by 3.15 we stop refilling the food, but we were not informed about it. If they wud have told us we wud not be waiting. I asked for check, waiter was very rude to me he did not refill the food but he wanted the full amount, he wanted to charge for everything that we did not even eat. Hope owner caters the need of customers rather than just being after taking out money for the hopeless service. NEVER GO BACK BACK AGAIN <br>

			Spicy indian food. Something I look forward to. Good amount of vegetarian choices. Meat lovers will probably have more choice. Desserts were okay, bit too sweet. The buffet is really worth the price.I take 2 star off due to the ambience. The place is overcrowded and the buffet counters are arranged at one end and in the center of seating place. Snacks, idli etc. would get over fast and refills took some time. When I went for grabbing a new plate, I could see plates with stains, as if someone forgot to wipe their hands before. They grabbed a plate, left their hand stains along with food, left the plate there itself. I do not blame the restaurant for this, but they should keep a check on people. <br>

			I'm surprised by the 4 star reviews. I thought the food was a solid 3 stars, and the service mediocre. The main reason I would have second thoughts about returning is that the restaurant is not that clean. I'm not a clean freak by any means- but I saw splattering on a couple of the walls and the bathroom was gross. Makes me worried... <br>

			Like most Indians in the outskirts-of-Boston area, I'm familiar with Godavari. For an area so densely packed with South Asian restaurants, it's hard to come by cuisine that doesn't taste like it's pandering to American foodies (read: most Indian restaurants in Boston/Cambridge.) Godavari offered the kind of no-nonsense, straight-from-India fare that makes me weak in the knees and I brought my family there in the hopes that they would be similarly debilitated....but oh, how the mighty have fallen.Rava dosa:We specified that we prefer crispy dosa and the server confirmed that he would have them prepare this crispy, laughing in agreement that soggy dosas are on par with moldy bread and Guy Fieri on the spectrum of culinary disappointments. Guess what kind of dosa arrived (hint: this is a 2 star review.) In addition to being soggy, the dosa had onions piled on top of it instead of mixed into the batter, as is standard with rava dosa. Maybe this is an iteration of rava dosa I'm unfamiliar with, but I prefer not to sift through a landfill of raw onion to get to my food.Uttapam:This, along with the rava dosa, was the ONLY dish that arrived in a timely fashion. I wish I had more to say on it taste-wise, but I'm personally not a fan of uttampam. The person who ordered it seemed satisfied; however it was nothing mind-blowing. Chicken Biryani: I'll give credit where credit is due - this dish was AWESOME. It's technically the 'Special Biryani' they had this month. From my understanding, the standard chicken biryani has bones, and this one was boneless. Unlike most of the dishes, it was well-plated - piled high with yellow rice and decorated with rings of onions and halved eggs. The chicken was tender and well-spiced and restored some of my faltering faith in Godavari. Of course, it would have been better if it had arrived, say, less than 30 minutes after everyone else finished their meals. Dosa Debacle:OH BOY. We ordered two sada paper dosa and close to an hour later, received one masala dosa. Clearly, there was something lost in translation, which would have been excusable, had the server conducted himself with any shred of decency when explaining the problem to us. Rather than accepting that he'd misheard the order, he insisted that we never ordered more than one dosa and kept mentioning how now the chefs were yelling at him too...as if their frustration should have mitigated ours? When we asked whether it was possible to add the dosa to the order now, he said it would be a minimum of 90 minutes before we would receive it. Ultimately, one of the guests never received his dosa and had to order something else, and none of us received an apology from our waiter for the inexcusably rude service. Customer Service:I'm not the type of reviewer to dock stars because a waiter is busy or inattentive - but these people were rude, stubborn, and cared much more about deferring the blame than remedying their error. The original waiter never so much as offered an apology, and the majority of the staff who spoke with us were shockingly insulting. One waiter was considerate and offered apologies on the part of his colleagues, but at that point, it did little for the sour taste in our mouths. Overall Impression: There was a time when Godavari was my go-to for good food and reliable service, but it seems to have dropped its standards on both fronts. I'll be approaching it with much more apprehension in the future. If you do decide to go, be prepared for a long wait, particularly on the weekends...and have your waiter repeat your order back to you. Twice. <br>

The idly veppudu was so good that my hard core meat eater colleague thought he was eating a chicken dish :P . Decor was nice. Scooter was a nice touch. Paneer Briyani was a disappointment. Definitely a must try place. <br>

			Godavari is one of my favorite most places for authentic south Indian food in Boston! While excellent flavored food is their forte, I think they should really put in some efforts in upping the ambience of the place. We went for dinner on a Sunday evening. A big group of 9 people, we had an equal mix of carnivores and vegetarians, we ordered some interesting starters like Gobi manchurian and vepudi idli in the vegetarian section and Hyderabadi machhli and chicken lollipop for the NV lovers. The main course had the group favorite mirchi ki salan and vegetable biryani for the veggie peeps and chicken biryani for the rest. I particularly like their This grand mughlai fare paired with Thumbs Up (Indian cola) was the ultimate combination for a hungry group of foodies! We went back home with a full and happy tummy! Definitely going back! These guys are also famous for their grand buffets that occur every month on certain sundays. Indian food lovers must try this place! <br>

			I was there last week for dinner with my family.. I am a huge fan of spicy food. Take it from an Indian guy.. this food is quite close to the authentic stuff!! Obviously the gravies are a bit rich & decadent. Tried the following:1. Chicken Lollipops (high recommended if you love spicy food)2. Chicken 65 ( pretty good)3. Baby corn 65 - quit good. 4. chicken biryani - also quite good. Loved it all. Next aim is to try out their famous lunch buffet. Minor comments: decor can be improved. I think they do serve Beer, but it was not advertised on the menu. Maybe they can expand on it. <br>

			Godavari is our Go-To South Indian restaurant. They keep us impressing every time with different dishes at Buffet and just recently , they even had a dosa and chat station outside which was awesome. Their buffet tastes good Every time. Love their Non-veg biryani,Methi chicken appetizer, chicken lollipops apart from other vegetarian yummy authentic Andhra dishes . I give 4 stars because its always over crowded and when we went for Ala carte Dinner,the waiters ,though courteous yet sometimes forget waiting or respond late due to over crowd <br>

			So so good! The food is incredible and the wait staff is so nice and friendly. I've been multiple times and they always recognize us. All of the staff is very friendly and chatty-- we always go to Godavari before we go to Jordan's Furniture and they always ask what movie we're seeing, if we liked the last one.And also the food is AMAZING. It's so delicious every time. Highly recommend. I wish they delivered to Davis square! <br>

			Second time in a row, so it required a review. First time, the delivery arrived over an hour late. Plus, the delivery guy called me, and was trying to negotiate on the phone to have me come across the street in my pajamas to his car. Seriously?Second time, tonight. Only 15 minutes late (but that was 1.5 hours from when we ordered) but failed to include the rice. Didn't feel like calling them to ask for the basics. The food may be ok, but the service S.U.C.K.S. <br>

			Ah....a south Indian restaurant serving spicy but delicious food! So loved it.We went here at 8:30PM on a wednesday evening, and we had a good 20 minute wait. After we got seated the service was pretty good. We went all in, and ordered paneer chilli, chilli chicken and gobi manchurian as appetizers. I loved them all! For entrees we got the chitoor noodles, malai kofta and chicken biryani ! They were all very good. My friend got the mini idlys's too and said the sambhar was great. My only complaint was that the rasmalai was just ok, and it was 5$ for a small cup. Overall, a good Indian restaurant to try if you are in mood for some spicy but delicious food. <br>

			We have eaten take out from here multiple times and the food has always been consistently good. This past weekend, we ordered take-out from Godavari via Yelp's Eat 24 delivery. Our food was no where to be found after 2 hours and Eat 24 was no help trying to track down our order. We finally called the restaurant and were told that their kitchen was backed up and it would take another hour for delivery. So, word of caution- if ordering take out, call them directly, don't go through Yelp EAT 24. <br>

			Haven't even received the food yet and I'm already not a fan. We ordered takeout (not delivery) and we chose the pickup time for 5:30. It's 6:30 and we're still sitting here at the restaurant waiting for the food. Bad way to run a business. They say it will be out soon. So heads up, if you plan for take out, the pickup times are meaningless. It's anybody's guess as to when your food will be ready. If you're eating in the restaurant, does it take an hour?Amended- our second experience at Godavari. Not quite as slow but horrible food!! I ordered the malai kofta. The sauce was fine but there were only three balls. And one of them was super crunchy. Not sure if it was burnt or super stale. Gross. And for 14$ - a total ripoff. Also got a paneer dish, again, very little paneer. Not going again. We've tried twice and it's super bad service and the food tonight was bad and not worth the money. <br>

			I read through the reviews on this site before going there, and I really should've listened to everyone's bad experiences. I have no idea how anyone gave this place anything other than 1 star. I went on a Friday evening around 830PM and there was a large group of people just clustered around the door. There was no host, no greeting, nobody to write down who came first, and no one to tell us how long the wait would be. The staff bustled around the tables, studiously ignoring the entire area around the front door. This should have been my first sign about the unprofessional and disorganized mess that the rest of the night would be. After about 20 minutes, one of the waiters finally approached the many people at the door and asked who had come first because there was now a table available. We were seated and did not get water for an additional 10 minutes. Then we immediately ordered the food, and waited. And waited. 35 MINUTES later, the appetizers were brought out at the same time as our food. Except for one member of our group who waited an entire hour because they clearly FORGOT about the order. We reminded them several times within this one hour, and they kept saying it "would be out in a minute". In all the busy restaurants I've been to, I have NEVER had to wait an entire hour for food to arrive. This was beyond ridiculous. Our group only had 4 people, how is it possible to miss an entire order??The staff was inattentive. rarely filled water glasses, didn't ask how the food was (and it was not good at all). It was way too salty and spicy (and I say this as a South Indian). Will not be back and don't recommend. <br>

			I remember when this place was Ambassador- oh the lunch buffets we had! Anyway, the family has ordered here several times since opening and I have the following to review:First time ordering after they changed name, the delivery was an hour wait due to food prep, business, etc. That was fine and dandy- no issues there. The delivery guy sat there telling me how "Foodler takes most of the money including my tip. I only work part time and I need the money." Nice story my friend, here's your signed slip. I'm closing the door now! I called the restaurant the following Monday and lodged a complaint. Haven't seen that guy since...hmm!Second- most recent time ordering have been good, be it an insanely long wait for food each time. The dosas are always soggy, ordered them twice and never again. Butter chicken, and Tikka Masala are touchy- it depends on who is cooking that night. Some nights they are bursting with flavor and other nights they're not. The Palak Paneer is good, and that's what I generally order. It's expensive food so we don't order often, but generally it's good and the delivery people are quite pleasant. <br>

			I have been visiting the restaurant since last two years. Its surprising that the quality and standards keep going low and low as the time passed by. Last friday 6 of us visited the restaurant for dinner. Firstly the food took more than one hour to arrive. Secondly i order the same dish every time I visit godavari and thus it becomes very evident for me to compare the quality over time. The dish i had was so poorly made. Thirdly veg dosa that my friend ordered had some nasty smell to it. May be its the oil or something else, we dont know. We didnt complain as it was closing time and we just let it go. But overall the taste and the quality has decreased to such a drastic level over time. <br>

			Courteous staff, authentic and great tasting food, and efficient delivery make this the best Indian restaurant in the New England area.Authentic Andhra/Telangana cuisine is a rare find in the US as most Indian restaurants tone down spice levels and hotness and simplify the menu to cater to a wider audience. Godavari, thankfully, is a welcome exception! They offer special Andhra/Telangana dishes such as Gongura Mutton, Nellore Fish Curry, and Chicken 65, making their menu a south Indian food lover's delight.I tried their Hyderabadi Mutton Biryani, Gongura Mutton, and Rayalseema Chicken Fry in my first order. In subsequent visits, I've also tried Kodi Vepudu (chicken fry), Andhra Biryani, and Chicken 65. Each item was superbly prepared and was reminiscent of food back home in Hyderabad. Moreover, the service levels were excellent with polite staff and timely delivery.I highly recommend this restaurant for an authentic south Indian food experience! <br>

			Food is very authentic. The restaurant is filled with Indian families and their families out to dinner. The service is good although English is a bit of a struggle. I can't have gluten and none of the waitstaff knew what gluten is or if the dishes contained gluten. As such I didn't eat as many dishes as I wanted as I really wasn't sure (outside of the obvious) what has gluten and what does not. If you want spicy Indian good they can deliver! Yum! <br>

			My dinner experience was bad. I ordered "Cut Mirchi" whose description in the menu was "Chilli bajji refried and sprinkled with onions, chat masala". When the dish was served, there were no onions. When I checked with the waiter, he said offered to get me onions and they were onion slices - not the finely diced cubes as they must be. The Mysore Masala that I ordered was not anywhere close to being real. It was yet another Masala Dosa. I enquired about Pesarattu and asked if they serve Ginger Chutney with it - again a basic requirement with this dish - and they didn't have any. I went with lot of hopes to get some good home food and came out disappointed. I hope that this is an issue with only this outlet. I shall try again elsewhere before I drop this off my list. <br>

			I went on a Sunday for their lunch buffet. It was PACKED, but despite the large crowds we were able to get a seat quickly. The food was extremely good, but very spicy. We inquired about less spicy options in the buffet line, but were told that on the weekend, they kick up the spice level. Weekdays are a bit more tame, we were informed. I would love to go back on a weekday and see if I was better able to tolerate the spices! (For the record, I do not have the best spice tolerance, so others may be able to handle the food better than I).  The staff was phenomenal though! We were plowing through water, and they refilled our glasses the minute they emptied. A great experience overall. <br>

			I've been here twice for the lunch buffet. Being a vegetarian, I always find it challenging to find good food. Godavari has a good selection of food, don't get me wrong, but I have an issue with the taste. It's not up to the mark. The last time I went, I complained about the palak paneer having too much salt, but they were courteous enough to take the dish back inside and make alterations. I don't find any dish here that I fall in love with. On the other hand, my husband and his friends love the non-veg dishes, especially the chicken dishes. <br>

			My first visit to Godavari - the successor to Ambassador - was for their lunch buffet. The only similarities are that they continue to have a really large variety of dishes on the buffet (even more now), and that they kept the tandoori chicken and chicken tikka masala. The majority of the dishes are Southern Indian in nature. I was not a fan of as many of these dishes personally, but that was only as a matter of taste. There's no denying the quantity of dishes on the buffet, and the quality is there as well. Many of the dishes were new to me, and the dishes I liked, I really liked. The tandoori chicken was perhaps the most tender I have ever had, with the meat just about falling off the bone. I also enjoyed the beet dish and the fried chicken and peppers. There is a wide variety of rices and rice dishes. They also include chai on the buffet table, something Ambassador did not offer.There were not 1 but 3 different desserts, a rice pudding, a fruit custard/pudding, and carrot halwa. The halwa was my favorite among the desserts; it had a rich flavor and was nowhere near as sweet as I've had it elsewhere. The rice pudding was savory instead of sweet, and I believe it actually had some peppers in it. The fruit custard felt a bit industrial, almost like a vanilla custard with a deep mango flavor added (too strong to be made from actual mangoes). I would have liked to see a few additions. The first would be knives at your table. The majority of the meat dishes feature meat still on the bone, and a knife would have helped immensely. I also would have like to have my water glass filled a little more frequently. But overall, I thought they did a very good job with their lunch buffet. <br>

			This is fine. We ordered the palak paneer and it was unfortunately under seasoned, the tiki masala chicken was delicious and so was the dosa which I had never tried before. I give it only 3.5 stars because when we ordered I ordered a dessert and got this strange bean soup. Our order took about 45 min to arrive, which wasn't bad at all. I would recommend if all you want is a solid amount of Indian food. And something that is generally authentic. <br>

			My fiance and I went there for a nice buffet.I liked the food but her favorite dish Saag Paneer was unavailable at the buffet.We asked the waiter if they had any and he immediately responded "yes it's coming." After 10 or so minutes we asked another waiter and he said they don't have that dish at the restaurant (or at least that day).It would be nice if the first gentleman, listened to the question and knew what was specifically asked or at least the facts instead of answering just to seem appealing to the guest as if they wouldn't very soon find out eventually that what was stated was obviously untrue.Based on the experience and our interaction with him, it appeared as if this is how he handled it. <br>

			This place is arguably one of the best places for an Indian food buffet in the greater Boston area.

The food is authentic and there is a huge variety of dishes, both vegetarian and non vegetarian. <br>

			I have seen many reviews about this restaurant, food is good, service is good and all. I want to bring up one important thing, like many other Indian restaurants even this guy, doesn't pay tips to his servers.. I feel really bad for the people who work there, earning tips for his boss, it's very cheap as its there hard earned money.. Only request to all restaurant owners, please pay the tips to the people who work there, customers who pay tip thinks it will go into hard working employees, not into boss's pocket.. Don't want to offend anyone, but want to bring out the fact.. Thanks <br>

			Checked In late Tuesday night and surprised to see the restaurant was almost full @9:30pm. Very good food I had in the recent times. If you like spicy food try Gobi 65 and Dal Tadka, awesome...going back today. <br>

			Got takeout.  Tiki Masala with an order of somosas.  Total Cost was a little more than $21. First off, there was barely any meat in Tiki Masala.  It wasn't even a lunch portion. Also the meat that was there was tough.  And usually, when you order Samosas, you get a green sauce to accompany them... we didn't get any sauce.  Also, when we showed up to get the order, there is no host to tell you where to get your order. I waited and waited and finally asked a waiter, where to go and he literally ignored me.  I had to ask him three times. He finally told me.  There are certainly better options not too far away. It is strange to say this but the Quick Serve Indian Restaurant at the Burlington Mall Food Court is much better. They are more reasonably priced, they give you more meat with your order and they even give you the green sauce when you order somosas. But if you are looking for a sit own experience, the Royal Indian Bistro in Lexington is a much better option. Its a similar cost, but they give you an appropriate amount of meat in their main courses.  Also the service is much better, and with Much, Much Better food.  Such a bad experience. <br>

			1. This place is not for vegetarians ( it's South Indian style food everything have sugar in it ) 2. Who ever gave them reviews 4* ???( either they doesn't know about Indian food or They have terrible taste an Indian food )3. Why I gave them 1*. Cause food was terrible, cold , and they put sugar in the food. Which makes food taste wired. <br>

			Hair in my rice, "no sir, we dont have that", "look at the menu" and food poisoning. That pretty much sums it up.Hair in my rice - This is what we found and the response: Yeah, I will tell the manager and get back. No one got back. Instead they pack it in a to-go bag. The hair was damn long!we dont have that - That's the response to every item we'd ask. Really???look at the menu - Yes, thats the response to a question we'd have. Is the idli immersed in sambhar, well look at the menufood poisoning - Yes, my sister got food poisoned and was throwing up 3 hours later.So, there you have it friends. Not worth it. The food: very oily, spicy, and super salty. The Gobi Manchurian - We only tasted the salt. <br>

			We moved to Boston from Houston & with that being said, it's always hard finding the best restaurants. After many failures, we finally found a nice quality Authentic South Indian Buffet! We live in Revere & manage to come by every other weekend. Come early because waiting list is long, but buffet is worth the wait! Everything is Tasty & Delicious, save room for dessert! Wish they open another one a bit closer! <br>

			This review is long overdue! We have visited this place almost a dozen times, mostly for the buffet. Their dishes are really authentic and extremely good (I am from South India, so I believe I am a good judge), and I am yet to taste a really bad dish from here! The staff are really friendly and the service is fine (I would not say great, but I am happy to overlook that for the food). Overall, a must visit place if you are a fan of south Indian food or if you want to try something different from the usual Indian fare. <br>

This place always seem to have something new. Here's a tip, arrive for lunch between 1130-noon and you won't have to wait in line. Place gets filled quick after noon. <br>

			Absolutely the best indian food I've had in years. I got the lamb achari extra spicy, and it blew my mind. I love achari, and it's hard to find as the primary taste at most indian restaurants. The spice level was definitely hotter than expected, and the sauce was thick and well balanced. I ordered pickup and it took a while, but when I got there I saw that there were about 20 people waiting inside for tables, and another 5-10 waiting outside, so it was completely understandable. After eating, I can absolutely see why people were willing to wait so long to get in. <br>

			Excellent buffet (on weekends). The food is very authentic south Indian. I was glad to find an authentic south Indian restaurant in the Boston area that is actually good. Unlike most other Indian restaurants, the buffet menu changes every day. The A la carte is pretty good too. Don't get the standard tikka masala or other curries that you see in every Indian restaurant. They offer some authentic dishes that I haven't come across outside of India - so give those a try. You won't be disappointed. <br>

			We went to this place thinking of the former restaurant in that spot- Ambassador. then we realized it was a new restaurant but the food smelled really good, and it was packed with Indian folks. That was a great sign!My fiance wasn't too happy with the food, but it's not because it was bad, but because he's not fond of south Indian cuisine. He wanted your typical American-Indian food.. ya know, Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Korma, etc.I thought this food was delicious, spicy but packed with tons of flavor! We went on a Sunday afternoon and they had buffet. I checked-in with Yelp and got $2 off our check! In total, it was $30+ with tip included and water for drinks. <br>

			Attempted to order something Vegan friendly unsuccessfully. Even the menu which says vegan option available for one dish isn't accurate. To their credit they at least told me this, but seriously, what Indian restaurant can't make a vegan friendly dish. With that said, Zaika in Woburn offers great food, so I will just continue to send my business their way instead. <br>

			Godavari caters to the north Boston and Boston metro crowd who craves for typical (close to authentic) south Indian food. Oh boy! When I moved to Boston four years ago I was frustrated with a lack of South Indian food options in Boston area. Used to go to Kebab and tandoor in Waltham whose dum briyani is the best in the town. Pongal is another south Indian option we have, but their offerings are not that great. My friends used to go to mirchi in Westborough from Boston for the South Indian food over the weekend. When godavari was open, it was like opening the gates of a flooded water dam.Crazy mad rush largely attributed to their offerings which are crowd favorite. All kinds of briyani, chettinad chicken, mirchi bhajji you name it. Most of them are very well made too. My only problem with them is spicy, they add way too much red chilly powder just to make it hot.so, every time you need to tell them explicitly you need less spicy. I do understand food business is tough, you need to have good cook for Indian items or else it will be a total disaster. Their weekend buffett are super crowded. I hope they maintain this taste and attitude forever. Keep up the good work Godavari. Never ordered any home delivery, can't speak for that. <br>

			Food is good but the service is terrible. We were kept waiting for drinks/water for 20 minutes and then somebody came to ask for water. The waiters would walk by our table but didn't ask for anything even the water jar on our table was empty. Other than that, Biryani was tasty. The signboard was broken when I went there so found it tricky to locate the entrance. Not sure if I'll dine in, maybe pickup or delivery for Biryani. <br>

			**5 stars if my standards were Boston alone. 4 because I compare also to other cities :-)FINALLY regional, non-watered down Indian food around boston!!! Hallelujah. After manhattan/ NJ 'burbs, I had been craving for fragrant, regional Indian menus. Someone up there heard my prayers and sent Godavari. It's unapologetically South Indian: Fish curry, mutton/ chicken pulau, various types of fluffy crepe-like snacks and dosas...all are extremely well done. The un-initiated should beware: this ain't some place to get your mild creamy chicken tikka masala, garlic naan, and mango lassi to wash everything down. This is spicy, it's got plenty of lovely spices, the rice is rich and nutty! Note the chai is done properly, not the bland skim-milk chai "juice" you get at other places. <br>

			Order for delivery on two separate occasions. Both times the food took over 1.5 hrs to arrive, I had to call (several times to just get them to pick up and not go to answering machine) and almost remind them of my order. And then the kicker...when the food arrived the driver sat for a few minutes on his phone out in the street while I wait at the door. What? Sure I'll wait while you finish talking and let my 1.5 hr delivery get colder. Don't let me rush you. I'd give one star if it were not for the fact that the food upon arrival has been pretty darn good. But not good enough to wait at least 1.5 hrs. Ambassador may not have been as good, but damn they were quick and made customer service and delivery a priority. Either address your delivery woes or simply don't offer delivery. Disclosure: order placed on a Saturday night at 8 pm via Foodler and arrived at 9:30. One appetizer and two curry dishes. Not really a large order. <br>

			"The best South Indian restaurant in the world"This restaurant should be ranked #1 so far as South Indian food is concerned. I was amazed at the unique way of care is taken to ensure that all customers are fully satisfied and taste all the variety available here. On the whole, the ambience, supremacy of the quality of each and every ingredient that go into the making of the dishes, the way the food is served, all make you feel that you are on the top of the world. This is the best South Indian restaurant of the world. <br>

			Godavari replaced Ambassador. The buffet is still great, and includes more options than Ambassador's buffet did. I've been twice now, and both times I was there one of the employees brought fresh, hot dosas (basically Indian crepes) to my table. The offerings here are slightly different than Ambassador's as the new owners offer a lot more South Indian dishes. Service is very friendly and the food is good.I ordered delivery once (via Foodler), and it took almost two hours (and several phone calls to the restaurant) for it to arrive. It was still hot when I got it though, so I guess I can't complain TOO much. <br>

			I am so disappointed. We ordered delivery which came 80 minutes after placing the order. I had indicated we would pay cash- the driver had no cash for change. The prices were so high- plus there was already a delivery fee-- I was expecting amazing. It was awful. We ordered everything mild- and it was all incredibly spicy. Except the Poori and Chapatis, all bordered on so spicy, it was inedible. $50 for all of this- plus the Kheer arrived hot, probably because it was packed with hot food, not separated. Also, the rice came in a small styrofoam box, about half of what your typically get from any other Indian restaurant. Sadly, this was a HUGE waste of money. I'm sad as the restaurant in a few miles from home and we LOVE Indian food. <br>

Right on point and delicious as fuck. Then ordered the Chicken lollipop but lacked sodium. I also ordered the Paneer Dosa that had the right spice to it. Overall, truly recommend this place and the service was exceptional. A very friendly staff - the guy kept giving us more papad. <br>

			This review is for the weekday lunch buffet. Chaos reigned when I arrived around 130 pm. When I finally flagged down a server they directed me to a table but directed me to the buffet first. As a non-native, there was no indication what any of the dishes were. The food was cool and dried out. Spoons had been moved from one dish to another and so there was a lot of "cross talk". Dishes that looked spicy were mild and mild appearing dishes were fire-y. The only good thing was that my water glass was filled promptly. Don't plan on coming back. <br>

			I always craved for real South Indian food here in Boston area. I have been to every restaurant that you might have heard of in and around Boston (east-west, north-south). Well, yes, there are restaurants that serve dishes tasting close to the South Indian food. And, there are restaurants that specialize in one specific dish (Biriyani or curries or dosas, etc.). But, this is the first place here that serves authentic most of the South Indian dishes! I should say Godavari is doing a great job and I would suggest the folks to stick to their current menu and authenticity. I am one of those lazy guys who always look at Yelp for reviews, but have never written one. This is my first review. That might help you understand how much I liked the food here. :) <br>

			I went here for a Sunday lunch buffet. To start with, there was a lot of variety in the dishes. Most of the food was south Indian with a few staple north Indian dishes thrown in. The service was prompt and friendly. Each table had a basket of naans, which were warm and soft. Food:The uttappams were to die for. The sambar was tasty as well, but what really hit the mark was the rassam. It was yum! I was particularly impressed by the chicken biryani, one of the few places which got it right. (biryani isn't supposed to have veggies, people!) The chutneys tasted authentic as well. I'll definitely be checking out this place again. I hope they keep up the standards of deliciousness. <br>

			This is our favorite Indian restaurant in the area. South Indian cuisine is awesome! We love buffet, a lot of vegetarian options, though we are not vegetarians, we love all. If we have dinner there we always order Masala Dosa there and combine it with different meat and vegetarian dishes. Guys who work there are amazing, they play with our kid and turn on wonderful music. Yes, it could be crowded on the weekend but it is a good sign for me. Recommend it! <br>

			Well it was my first time to this place. Landed on a Sunday buffet. There was a small wait for a few minutes. Then we were guided to our seats. The plates were not washed properly. After carefully selecting and cleaning we got some clean enough plates. There were variety of dishes. I can speak for vegetarians, it has a decent choice. Not a place I want to go back though. <br>

			People usually write a review either when they have extreme emotions about a place. This review is an expression of delight. Godavari is the taste of south India! Go there to surprise your culinary senses. You will experience South India in America. My parents were visiting Boston for my graduation and I had the opportunity to bring them here.Not just the food, the ambience and the people were fantastic. Keep it up! <br>

			Excellent south Indian food!! Great variety. Very inexpensive!Been here twice. Did the buffet once, ordered from the menu the other time. I have to say that this is my new favorite Indian restaurant. My advice - Just come here and taste the best south Indian food in the Boston area!! <br>

			Godavari's predecessor (Ambassador Restaurant) was bad. In comparison, Godavari is so much better:1. The initial few weeks were good. Food was fresh and a welcome change.2. The service is 6/10. The staff is good but can't seem to keep pace. Maybe the bottleneck is in the Kitchen.3. Recently, the food quality is slipping and there is no variety in the buffet selection. You get the same every time you are there. Kind of like McDonald's but then that's not the purpose. Have tasted dried Biryani at 12:45 PM. The replenishment time for dishes is long - forcing patrons to stare at empty containers.Hoping these guys can pull up their socks and be like the initial few weeks. The owner and is wife have mostly been there and that's helpful. Actually, there was a difference in the food quality in their absence (like today). <br>

			My chicken tikka was a strange dark brown color and smelled very off; upon tasting it it was unpalatable and I wound up unfortunately having to dispose of my whole $40 order. Navratan kurma was also strangely dark with odd white foam on top :( Very disappointing as I was looking forward to Indian food all day! I recommend avoiding this place; I work a very low-paying job and this was my food budget for several days wasted. Wish I could have the food money back for this week's small budget. If there had been any chance I could have eaten the food I would have, and I have friends in the restaurant business and really don't post negative reviews ever or take them lightly. I agree with Mohit; I'd give them zero stars if I could. <br>

			We went here at 1pm and the restaurant was packed full. Okay, it's peak weekend lunch time hours - but there was a long queue of around 50 people waiting in the hot sun outside, to get a place. We ended up waiting for 2 hours to be called up. The restaurant is v much in demand as their buffet is v good. Godavari might need to expand the seating area, to continue catering for huge groups of customers. <br>

			This is recommended to me by my Indian friend. It's good. And it must be authentic because I see many Indian customers. The food is very good but a bit too spicy for my taste. The service is very good. The waiter went out of his way to make sure that we have everything that we need. <br>

			This place is a hidden gem for authentic south Indian food. I've never been disappointed here. They have some unique offerings that are a welcome change from the typical cream heavy"curry"dishes served at most Indian restaurants. There fish kakinada is my personal fav and is served as a whole fish on a bed of salad. Their goat meat app is also another fav. Joys the server, is very knowledgeable and has never failed in his recommendations. The good food and attentive service is what makes me keep coming back!! <br>

			I visit this restaurant regularly. The food here is authentic and delicious. The only issue I faced was they don't have adequate seating to accomadate single customers and results in long wait times. Once when I got take out, my order was completely forgotten and had to wait an hour or so. But all the more, the food makes you forget minor hospitality issues. <br>

			One of the best South Indian restaurants I have ever been to in the US.. There are some great ones in NJ, Chicago and Atlanta but this is by far the best by a long ways - for pure taste authenticity and variety ..The ones that are better are a few thousand miles away in Hyderabad and chennai ..If you like flavorful food(somewhat spicy too but that is South Indian food) which is authentic to its bone.. This is the place to come.. Very friendly almost family like staff which makes the place an experience that goes beyond just the good food...The service is outstanding.. They are on top of things even if the restaurant is full.. Everyone single person here is awesome but in particular Joe and Sudhesh in the restaurant are our favs.. They are our kids best friends as well... Some of our family favs- Cavan-7yrs - he will do all the chores in the house for chicken 65.. That is saying a lot..Rogan-9yrs - he loves the Dosa..almost as much as he likes to climb which is his passion Myself- their dum biryani takes me back to Hyderabad, upma reminds me of my grandma, goat roast medium spicy is the bomb and I can't stop eating their gongura goat..Leslie- she can eat their shrimp65 and upma all day long.. Their eggplant dishes are some of her favs as well.. Come down here on a sat. Or sun for buffet at 12 to avoid lines.. Yes there is a wait time and for a good reason.All in all.. A Must go place .. And it's not just for the food.. But for the people AND the food.Suresh <br>

			We went for a weekend buffet(~$14) and the food was amazing. There was a small waiting queue to get in but it was worth the wait. There were good number of waiters but still the thing was not managed perfectly, may be because there were a lot of people that day.Anyway, the food was delicious. The spice level was perfect. Most of the items were south indian but there were some north indian delicacies as well like chana masala, daal tadka. Few dishes which require special mention are mutton and Chicken Biryani, pongal, malai kabab, shrimp curry, rasam and Phirni!I hope they maintain the level of their food!Definitely worth a visit. I am gonna visit them again. <br>

			Awesome food and service!!! This is my first review. Never had patience to write a review but this experience is worth sharing. I regularly visit Godavari as I love their buffet(Veg). I ordered catering for my daughter's bday and the food was amazing. All guests were satisfied with the taste and quality of the food. It was fresh and delicious. Got very positive feedback from them (not the formal feedback given out of courtesy but most of them are my close friends, so it was honest feedback). Totally worthy. Things were handled professionally from providing quote to delivery. They customized few dishes to suit our requirement and spice levels. They had to deliver food to our venue, 35 miles from the restaurant. Food delivery got delayed by 15-20 mins than the agreed time due to vehicle breakdown but Jaswanth ensured that the delivery was not too late for lunch time. We were informed about the delay and as a good gesture, he was courteous to waive off delivery charges (which we returned later as we knew it was not their fault).Happy to select Godavari for catering, made my day !! Thanks Jaswanth and team Godavari :) <br>

			Came with high expectations based on yelp reviews. Experience was mixed.Service: Mediocre. On the one hand, the staff were very polite and friendly. On the other hand, they repeatedly forgot or messed up our order, and my partner ended up finishing her dinner before my (wrong) order ever showed up. This isn't a deal-breaker for me; it just tells me that the next time I need to hound the staff a bit more.Food: mixed, but I blame myself for this. We got a lot of nontraditional dishes. The fish Vedupu was great (and classically south Indian spicy!). The biryani was excellent, but a bit spicy; my (spice-intolerant) partner found the aftertaste of the "medium" too strong for her, so if your spice tolerance is low, get it mild and/or get lots of raita. The Chennai Rava Dosa wasn't very good, but this may be because they messed up the order and it got cold while they fixed it. The Rasmalai tasted like it came out of a can. The mint chutney was substandard, the tomato chutney was fine, but the sambar was tasty. The masala chai was OK; they were out of the chennai coffee which is what I really wanted to try.Next time, I will focus on the basics: Idli, Masala Dosa, and Pyasam or Gulab Jamun. Hopefully, I will be back to update the review to a 5-star! <br>

			If you come here and have any sort of interest in good authentic cuisine or interesting spice combinations, you will love this place. The food is just amazing for the price!! Somewhere around 13.80$ for unlimited buffet of 10-15 absolutely amazing dishes. Came here with a buddy and the people working there were super nice and recommended some delicious deserts for us to take the heat from our tongues. This is probably the single best option for if you want to jump into all sorts of different southern Indian dishes for a very reasonable price, and it is worth the 30min drive from boston to check it out!! Basically an amazing variety of vegetarian dishes, rich meaty curries, tasty spiced deserts and chai to finish it off. Some tasty light spiced soups too. So you can have like 10 different entrees, small portions of each one, get a great sampling without having to pay 50$ for ordering 4 entrees. Just come here jeez it's so good <br>

			This is a review for their weekend lunch buffet. I really enjoyed the food and the service. This is a great find!My wife is a vegetarian, and there was enough good stuff to keep her happy. I tried the pappu(dal), dondakaya(tindora), pesarattu and chutneys, and they were really good.On the non-vegetarian side, I loved the mutton biryani, Madurai chicken and the crab legs curry. I hope they are able to keep their dishes authentic, and not get carried away by reviews that complain that the food is too spicy. There are enough other bland Indian restaurants in and around Boston to go to.Only complaint - It would be really nice if they could serve fresh naans in the buffet..I really do hate cold naans. <br>

			The best Indian food I have ever had out of India. This place is amazing. One of my friends took me here after telling me a million times that it's amazing. The Chicken Manchurian is an amazing appetizer with the Kababs. We ordered Chole Bhatture, Paneer Dosa, Chicken Biryani, Butter chicken, Garlic naan and Roti. There was not even one dish that I was a bit let down by, each of them attained perfection in terms of Indian food and spiciness. I would totally recommend this place if you are an Indian food lover. They use the freshest ingredients and portions are meant for great for sharing. Highly recommend this restaurant. <br>

Sometimes it's spicier than other times, probably depending on the chef, but it's always delicious. <br>

			This is our first time here and We had come for dinner tonight. We ordered channa batura, aloo gobi, naan and old city veg biriyani. I liked the vast menu options to choose from. The food tasted really good. Spice level was just as we ordered. The biriyani quantity was too much. It was a rush dinner night, but the person who waited our table, PRATAP was really good. He was patient and friendly.I will definitely be back to try the other items in the menu. <br>

			Went there for dinner tonight with my husband. Ordered a lot of food which included the biryani, tawa fish, and chilli chicken. We asked the server to make it spicy. The food was very very spicy. I didnt like the fact that the server kept food on the table ,like we were eating for free. It was literally like throwing food on the table. Also, the complimentary papad were uncooked , when i brought that to the notice of the waiter, he took those away and then returned to say that they dont have any papad anymore. Food is good, but service is pathetic, also short of papad not done. <br>

			Got takeout today! Tasteless and overly spicy chicken tikka masala despite having ordered mild. Navratan kurma was oddly bitter? And also overly spicy, looked like to make it "mild" someone had just dropped yogurt in the middle of it. Will never order again from here, I do not recommend, and I threw all the food away after tasting it. I really never throw food away and feel horrible about this; the order total cost as much as I earn in three hours at work and yet was really unpalatable. I know the restaurant business is hard and don't post this vengefully, more as a warning for other people who can't afford to buy food they wouldn't eat. <br>

			There is an unbelievable craze for this restaurant. Sample this, the restaurant opens at noon and people were waiting in line from 11.30 am for the weekend buffet. I wanted to try out the food just for the heck of it. The positives were they had very different non-vegetarian entrées like goat liver, shrimp pulao to name a few. But on the whole I didn't think the food was great. It was just another Indian buffet standard. Nothing extraordinary as the hype suggests... <br>

			Worst managed restaurant we had been to ever! Food never comes or it comes in no particular order !! If you do not know how to serve, why do you run a restaurant ? It was a busy night, alright, we did our part, we waited for about 20 minutes to be seated. After that, once we are seated ??!!! No water for 5 minutes, no waiter for 10 minutes. And finally someone comes takes our order, finally !! after 15 minutes in the table.Alright, we ordered a starter, an entree, rotis, naans and lassi. You guys could have got us the lassi quickly, can't that be done with some thinking ?! lassi comes after 10 minutes, then comes entree and rice, we are not rice eaters and that's f'ing why we ordered the rotis along. What was I supposed to do ? Sit and watch the entree forever. Roti never came!! Then comes my starter!!! Seriously ? Pull the shutters and let someone take your space instead of running something this pathetic. May be nobody should turn up singles or in pair, they are not welcome in the restaurant since their check would be less dollars compared to group. So if you are hungry, or couples or singles headed this way for food, make a U turn.These guys have a huge greed for money they put tables in every available gap you can't walk around but they don't give a crap about serving you correctly. <br>

			I went to Godavari again after a good experience with the food. But this time the quality of the same food that we order before turned out to be flavorless. The hyderabadi dum mutton biryani had no flavor. It was just rice with few pieces of goat meat at the bottom of the plate. The biryani was not warm and was very dry. The same Biryani we eat on the earlier visit was very flavorful with juicy mutton pieces. I would give them an OK rating as the quality of the food wasn't consistent. The servers are very busy fulfilling orders and doesn't care to check on their customers. We had to remind the server that we needed ice-cold water several times. I had heard good reviews about this restaurant from friends. I personally didn't have a great experience. <br>

			My new favorite restaurant in the area!This place specializes in South Indian cuisine and they do it right. Great flavors, excellent spices, well prepared. My favorites are the dosa and the Gobi Manchuria--you need to try this delicious appetizer of battered cauliflower in a red spicy sauce.I've also been to the lunch buffet, which is great. Many choices, both veg and non-veg, with rice, breads, salad, dessert, etc.The service has been great during my visits here, whether for eat-in or take out. The only thing I can say is sometimes they are a little slow, only because they are so popular and it is often busy. But it has never been a problem, just give yourself a little extra time. <br>

			We loved the food and reasonably priced as well. Went with a gang of 6 folks and so tried out many of their dishes, but there were so many good choices that we'll have to make few more trips to cover them all. It's a Telugu owner and so the cuisine has that Andhra touch to it. And found a good mallu server (the 1st one I found in Boston). Jose the server was really courteous and made sure we had a good time at the table. Quite an entertainer.Now back to the food.Appetizers:*guntur mirapakai bhajji:nice and spicy stuffed whole jalapeños, dipped in besan and deep fried. Would have preferred a bit less of the besan covering on it.*cut mirch:nice and spicy stuffed jalapeños cut into pieces,dipped in besan and deep fried.These bhajjis would have been good with pudina chuttneys or similar, but dont think they serve any.*gobi65: nice and crispy*bonda egg: bolied egg, dipped in besan and deep fried.not a big fan of boiled eggs, but others liked it.*fish filet fry: don't remember the name, but was a fillet tava fried. Nice spices and soft fish, maybe Tilapia.*prawn65: good sized prawns and tasty.*masala dosa: good, but would have liked better chuttneys though. Especially being from Andhra.*gutti vankay kora(eggplant): good blend of spices, the eggplant taste is nicely captured.*hangover buttermilk:was really thick and good.*gulab jamun: our server's recommendation. nice and hot, fresh and soft. Bit too sweet syrup though. But hey..that's what gulab jamuns r about.*rasmalai: the best one I have had in Boston so far. Really soft and nice malai.Overall a great place to enjoy Indian food and reasonably priced. Would love to checkout their famous buffets some weekend. Heard its always crowded. Buffet menu changes every time (but heard they also serve crab curry at times.!). Looking forward for the next visit.Update from next visit:So we went again, sat night dinner and the place was crowded. About 20mins wait for a group of 6.some of the new dishes we tried.*idly & madurai vada: nice and tasty dipped in sambar with chutneys*bengaluru bonda:aloo bonda.not a big fan. Was OK.*gobi65: was not so well made this time.not fully cooked. We informed our server and he conveyed it promptly to the chef. Offered to not charge it.*chicken lollipop: nice, crispy exterior and spicy.*mamsam roast(goat fry): this was nice & spicy with a little gravy. Loved it. Reminded me of preparation back home.*mango lassi: was really good. But too bad they ran out of fresh stock and we couldn't get additional refills.*kurnool kodi kura(chicken curry): okay. Nothing great.*karaikudi onion uthappam:okay. Nothing great.*Chennai rava dosa:okay. Nothing great.*teen maar onion dosa: just dosa with lightly fried onion pieces. Avoid. <br>

			Have to say, definitely worthwhile visiting! We were going to select one dish, but the waiter recommended a different (chicken lollipops) and we were very pleasantly surprised!! The curries were really good as were the rice dishes. We have yet to try the South Indian but based on our first experience here, will definitely be back to try more food as the menu is huge. The service was quite slow throughout so I do hope that is improved for next time. <br>

			Loved it! My friend said very authentic (he should know, as he is from South India). We went for the lunch buffet. It was inexpensive & had TONS of dishes to try... So if you are like me & never sure what to order but want to try everything- this is the perfect venue for that. It was busy..we waited about 10-15 min for a table but it was definitely worth the wait. The wait staff were very attentive (thank God... because some stuff was very spicy & I needed my water filled on a regular basis). I'm definitely recommending & looking forward to going again. <br>

			After having heard some positive comments from few of my friends we visited Godavari today on Monday(labor day weekend) in Woburn. We were a group of 14 so we had to wait for upto 45 minutes to get seated. By the time we went to have food, all most all the trays were empty in the non-veg area (around 1:30 pm). I had to wait for 10-15 minutes to get a naan, 30 minutes to get a kabab, 10 minutes to get chicken biryani tray filled up. No mutton items at all. No seefoood either. I had nan, butter chicken, kebab, gongura chicken (as per them) and biryani. It was a total disappointment once i tasted the dishes on my plate. I was not able to complete half of my plate after being a total food lover. There was no seasoning in kebabs, gongura chicken was full of masala flavor and bland, even chicken biryani was not upto the mark. I have given two stars only because my friends felt vegetarian was good. I will definitely not visit this restaurant if I want to eat non-veg dishes. I told the same thing to the Godavari restaurant management after our lunch buffet and he goes on saying that today things got mixed up and etc etc. If they (godavari management) call it's a good restaurant it should be good on weekdays too not just on weekends.Even worse was the check after our lunch buffet. We got billed for 28 members when we were just 14 in the group. We later realized that and went back to get the refund.I would prefer Mirchi in Westborough which is far better with somany varieties and tastes soo good and never disappointed me till date. If I visit burlington area I prefer pongal which is much better than Godavari. Even minerva in Natick is better than Godavari when compared to taste and varieties. Total disappointment for non-veg lovers.Definitely NOT worth the hype. <br>

			Great restaurant, tons of choices, extremely friendly service, and attentive waiters! Spice level was great, value for money is great if you're a local definitely should have room for left overs. Sadly staying at hotel no fridge. The reason I am giving 4 out 5 is because the lamb I received was extremely tough. I am a huge fan of lamb dishes and when I got it and wasn't the least bit tender that was a big let down. I loved the chicken dishes we tried but if you are a lamb fan try something else. Keep up the good work though! Rest was spot on! If I was a local I would be here often. <br>

			I'm not usually a fan of buffets of any cuisine type. Godavari's lunch buffet is a clear exception. Each item was unique and distinct, each flavor was interesting, and there was significant variety. The food was generally spicy - much like South Indian food should be. If you can't handle hot spice, ask for mild options. Service was friendly and attentive. My only complaint was the overly loud TV playing Bollywood movies. A great South Indian restaurant; looking forward to being back. <br>

			Went here for a buffet. It was really authentic South Indian food with correct level of spice for particular dishes. I also have visited Ambassador before and didn't particularly like their food because it was bland for an Indian standard. Godavari provides the spice level with almost complete authenticity. I just hope they keep up with this. <br>

			We stopped here for lunch on Sunday after doing some shopping at lumber liquidators. What a gem!!! My wife and I traveled India yen years ago and thought we pop in for a masala dosa but found that they only do a buffet. What an amazing buffet it turns out to be. I tried to try everything but got nowhere near close. Chicken tikka was super and tandoori chicken was excellent. Some other highlights were Bihar aloo and mango Dahl. People, it is all you can eat tandoori chicken!!! The staff were also very very friendly. I wish they would open a restaurant in Winthrop. I will be back. <br>

			I have been to Godavari a few times now, mostly during lunch hours (buffet), the very first time I went there, it was a weekday, the food was amazing and so was the service, I liked their menu and the way they make items really taste south Indian. The appetizers are usually good tasty and flavorful unlike other restaurants' who just put some stuff for the sake of it. Coming to main course, I remember few items like Rao garu pulao and tomato flavored rice, which are pretty good. Certain entree items like majjiga pulusu, which is usually made with yogurt and (drumstick or okra ) combination are unique to this restaurant.Their dal ( or pappu ) & fried curries are also very "Andhra" in style, other items like Rasam and Sambhar just cross the OK barrier. Being a vegetarian, I can only comment on veg biryani, which is much better than most restaurants in the Greater Boston area offer. Desserts just pass. Overall, most of the items are full of flavor and delicious. I have seen other people comment that certain items are too spicy, but I only felt that they are full of spice flavors, but not "spicy" per se.Although, the "get-in get-out" experience has been really painful lately, the lines are long, so is the waiting time, which is understandable given that they are doing really well, but managing such a crowd has not been dealt well, given that I have been seeing this for a few weeks now. Recently, when I took my in-laws to this place, the whole experience of getting our name on the wait-list, closely monitoring if your name was called and finally getting into the buffet line to get some food is excruciatingly painful. And when you get into the line, the chances are really high that most of the containers are empty with people staring at them helplessly, the rate & quantity at which the items are replenished is very slow and less respectively.The quality and taste of the food is really good compared most of the restaurants in the area, but a slightly botched management of the restaurants' operations makes me think once before visiting it again. I really wish they come out of this "boom" of the business with a well oiled plan and continue to excel. <br>

			This place is SOOOO good!!!! Finally, a really really really great Indian restaurant in the Boston area. They have a wonderful lunch buffet. The food is fresh, there is a great variety and the price is incredibly reasonable. They bring fresh warm naan and a crispy dosa to your table, which is included in the lunch. So much better than the former Ambassador! You must try it!!!!I just read other reviews and would like to comment. Yes, this place has only been open a week but the owner, Babu, was walking around and making sure customers were taken care of and OK. He genuinely wants his restaurant to be successful and was taking all comments seriously. His staff was very helpful, always refilled our water, cleared our dishes, and checked on the buffet tables. The food has a bit of spice but is not overly spicy. Also, there is North Indian and South Indian dishes offered but if you know your spices, you can tell that there is a very pleasant twist to the North Indian dishes. There is no need to be offended by North Indian dishes being offered- it makes for a more pleasing lunch! I wouldn't change a thing!!! <br>

			We have been here twice thus far and some of the dishes are excellent, while some are just OK. The Shanghai Chili Paneer and the Gobi Manchurian are among the excellent. We were pretty disappointed with the Chicken Tikka Masala - usually a signature dish at most Indian restaurants. It was too creamy and a little bland, some of the spices were just off and it didn't really taste like chicken tikka masala. Also there was probably only 4 pieces of chicken in the dish, most of it was just a bowl of gravy that was too creamy. They have a lot of kinks to work out in terms of service. The wait staff and other crew don't seem to have defined roles, so everyone is kind of running around every where and doing a little bit of everything. <br>

I had been there with friends on a Friday for lunch and they had buffet. All items were well Cooked and tasty. I would recommend trying out the egg masala and sambhar. I am a seafood lover and wish they had some seafood options. I would rate them as the best Indian restaurant in Woburn <br>

			This location used to have another name/management which was pretty bad.. recently renamed.. new management.. and new cooks apparently! What a difference! We have only tried lunch buffets so far but have been very impressed by the quality, taste and variety on the buffet menu. Good choices across the vegetarian table as well as the meats table.. and the desserts. The only issue with good quality food is.. you guessed it.. it gets too crowded :) They have limited seating space.. and limited waiting area.. so if you get there at peak time it can mess up your whole experience... too many families waiting.. noisy chaos.. just avoid that by going a bit early. <br>

			Got into hype and drove more than an hour to this place on Sunday for lunch. Tried buffet as first timer, lots of items in the spread but taste is subpar. Misuse of famous local names on cheap tasteless food. Owners put all their efforts in naming catchy names for their dishes, and the food taste is complete disgrace to their names- bezawada batu curry, Bollywood chicken etc., lots of emphasis on rhyming words than taste. Ambiance is OK, music/TV is loud and horrible restrooms. <br>

			Service: Slow, absent-minded, incoherent, and outright disrespectful. Looks like the management is saving some money by employing Indian college students from the area to serve the food and take the order. The guy who took our order kept swearing at his peers/management(I don't know) in a local Indian language. Food: Bland, tasteless. This place has no idea how much salt to use in their food; they use either too much or too little. Definitely NOT "truly south Indian" as they claim. Biriyanis were an insult to the tastebuds - not inedible, but a mix of plain rice and some bland chicken with some garam masala stuck on it doesn't make it a biriyani. It's BYOB. So there's one good thing about this place.Ambience: Restaurant does have an OK vibe to it. People waltz in and out of the kitchen with long, untied hair, wearing trench coats(this baffled me). This made me VERY suspicious of the quality of food.Summary: It is beyond me how this restaurant gets a rating of above 2 or 3 in other reviews. Definitely in the list of bottom 3 Indian restaurants in the Greater Boston area. <br>

So that was 2 hours and 20 minutes. Just save yourself and never order delivery here. Like Jfc. I asked them if they were willing to composite with a few bucks off the top and they flat out refused.

			Being South Indian, I can verify the authenticity of the food. It was like being at my mom's or aunt's house for dinner! The appetizers have huge portions; we ordered the shrimp 65, fried goat, and fried chicken appetizer and we were pretty full even before the main courses. Amazing food. The biriyani was great (large portion), as was the masala dosa. Will definitely be coming back. The place itself is no frills, but was packed because of the quality of the food. <br>

			Visited this place for the second time today, because wanted to give them second chance, the worst Indian restaurant in the Boston area. Management very obnoxious, quality of food very poor. Tried to tell the owner issues about the food, he does not get it. Food is very spicy, i.e. ordered Gobi Manchurian, asked them to make mild, they said, we can't because it is already marinated spicy, my guests had water in their eyes because of spice. quantity of dishes is very small as compared to price. Water jugs are filthy. If you don't want to spoil your evening, avoid going to this restaurant. <br>

			I went to godavari on a laborday long weekend after hearing some positive reviews from my friends..and i regret for that decision after i had my buffet. This place is small and there was a huge crowd and I had to wait for an hour to get our(7 members) turn. After getting in at around 145pm, most of the buffet items were empty, it took them around 15 minutes to fill them..no plates as well...finally after some waiting..got some plates...about food..vegetarian tasted fine with around 8 different options..in non-veg, there are 4 different chicken items which are not good at all. Seriously, None of them, even chicken biryaani. Overall we had a bad experience...definitely not worth the wait...i would not revisit this place. <br>

			My husband and I frequently try new Indian restaurants. He is from India, so the more authentic, the better. Godavari was just fantastic! We went to the Saturday buffet. Huge veg and non-veg selection. Rasam, chicken lollipop, biryani, spinach pakora, and goat curry were my favorites, but really, everything was so delicious, fresh, and perfectly cooked. It was probably the most authentic buffet we have had - the spice levels were actually great. Two buffets was like $29. My main complaint would be that it was way too crowded and difficult to navigate through the extremely congested tables and people. At lunch, you can ONLY get the buffet. I can't wait to try their dosa! <br>

			Went there for a weekday lunch buffet. Although their options were quite extensive and with an excellent amount of spice (note: I love spicy food!!), I do wish they brought out fresh and big rounds garlic naan to your table individually like they would do at Zaika Indian Bistro, which is also in Woburn. Instead they had small and somewhat dry pieces of naan at the buffet and they would be depleted very quickly by the other buffet goers. I read reviews for fish at the buffet which is awesome but when I went there was no fish :-( also when I went there was no more tandoori chicken except for a few small pieces! Not sure if that's because the bin was practically empty but if I go again I would like to see nice big pieces of tandoori chicken, preferably on the bone too (like with Zaika). They still did have amazing tikka masala and this mushroom dish (I loveee mushrooms). I wish they served samosas and goat curry at the buffet like Zaika did. The desserts at Godavari were not that great and disappointing but maybe that's because I went on a weekday? I have a feeling there would be better desserts at a weekend buffet. Just a suggestion in case it's not available for buffet: I think it would be nice to offer kheer (rice pudding) as a dessert option. I've had it in the buffet at Kashmir on Newbury Street a while ago and it was fantastic and I wish more Indian buffets would have it.Overall Godavari has lots of options available and I love the spiciness of their dishes. I do wish they incorporated more dishes that make other Indian buffets great. I think I will go back on a weekend and see if they do a better job. <br>
